# Integer Multiplication Algorithm using Karatsuba's Method

## Description

The **Integer Multiplication Algorithm using Karatsuba's Method** is an implementation of an optimized multiplication technique for large integers. This project demonstrates the use of **Karatsuba's algorithm**, which improves the efficiency of multiplying two large integers by reducing the computational complexity. The traditional multiplication method has a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \), while Karatsuba's method reduces it to \( O(n^{\log_2{3}}) \), making it much more efficient for large numbers.

This project allows you to multiply two large integers represented as arrays of digits using Karatsuba's approach, which divides the integers into smaller subparts and recursively performs multiplications.

## Problem Statement

Given two large integers of N digits each, represented as arrays of digits, the goal is to implement an algorithm that multiplies them using **Karatsuba's method**. The algorithm splits the integers into smaller subintegers, recursively multiplies them, and combines the results to minimize the number of multiplications required.

## Key Features

- **Karatsuba's Algorithm**: Efficient integer multiplication by recursively breaking down numbers and reducing the number of multiplications required.
  
- **Recursive Approach**: Implements a recursive strategy to handle large integer multiplication by dividing numbers into smaller parts.

- **Optimized for Large Integers**: Significantly reduces the time complexity for large integers compared to traditional multiplication methods.

## Implementation

This project includes the following components:

1. **Divide the Integers**: The algorithm splits the two input integers into smaller subintegers.
   
2. **Recursive Multiplication**: Using Karatsuba's method, the algorithm recursively multiplies the subintegers.

3. **Combining the Results**: The final product is obtained by combining the results from the recursive multiplications.
